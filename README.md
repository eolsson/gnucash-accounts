Some Account Hierarchy Templates for GnuCash in Swedish

I have developed a few account hierachies for GNU Cash and wanted to make them available to others.

Currently I have one for a sports club and another that follows GA accounting practices for small businesses in Sweden, "BAS Kontoplan".

I am working on one for personal finance.
