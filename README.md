Some Account Hierarchy Templates for GnuCash in Swedish

I have developed a few account hierarchies for GNU Cash and wanted to make them available to others. There's one for a sports club and two other that follow GA accounting practices for small businesses in Sweden, "BAS Kontoplan".

# BAS Kontoplan

[BAS Kontoplaner](https://www.bas.se/kontoplaner/) has up-to-date information about these account hierarchies.

# How to use the .gnucash-xea files

They should be included in the standard Gnucash installation but will only be available in the Swedish locale (specifically sv_SE). To create a new file based off of these hierarchies, use the New file guide and choose the desired account plan in the corresponding step of the guide.

You can also find general technical information about how this works on the [Account Hierarchy Template](https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Account_Hierarchy_Template) page of the Gnucash wiki.
